**Multi-AI Agent System for Automating Jupyter Notebook Data Science Workflows**

This report presents a conceptual framework and a prototype design for an automated, multi-AI agent system aimed at transforming the manual and iterative process of developing data science workflows in Jupyter Notebooks.

---

### Problem Statement

The traditional development of data science notebooks is time-consuming and iterative. Automating this process can enhance productivity, ensure consistency, and expedite insights.

---

### High-Level Architecture

#### 1. **Objective & Workspace Input**

* **Objective**: A natural language description of the desired analysis (e.g., "Analyze sales data and visualize trends").
* **Workspace**: A set of input files (CSV, JSON, images, etc.) with optional metadata or schemas.

#### 2. **Core Agent System**

A single intelligent agent or multiple specialized agents carry out different roles, including:

* Planning
* Code generation
* Execution
* Output analysis

#### 3. **Perception Module**

* **Workspace Scanner**: Identifies and reads available files and schemas.
* **Feedback Interpreter**: Analyzes code execution results, including errors and visual outputs.

#### 4. **Cognitive Module (LLM-driven)**

* **Planner**: Transforms objectives into step-by-step tasks.
* **Code Generator**: Produces Python code for each task.
* **Refinement Engine**: Uses execution feedback to improve plan/code.

#### 5. **Execution Environment**

* **Notebook Manager**: Creates and manages .ipynb files.
* **Cell Executor**: Executes code and captures outputs/errors.
* **State Tracker**: Tracks notebook state across cells.

#### 6. **Output & Persistence**

* **Notebook Assembler**: Finalizes the Jupyter notebook.
* **Summary Generator**: Produces a final report of steps and findings.

### Conceptual Python Implementation

The prototype includes:

* An `LLM_API_CALL` mock for planning, code generation, and analysis.
* A `Workspace` class simulating file discovery.
* A `JupyterExecutor` that uses `exec()` and `nbformat` to simulate notebook execution.
* A `JupyterAgent` class coordinating the process, storing context, and preventing infinite loops.

---

### Next Steps for Development

#### 1. **Improving LLM Interaction**

* Effective prompt design for each agent task.
* JSON-structured outputs for reliability.
* Context management for long sessions.
* Tool integrations: search, profiling, and visualization.

#### 2. **Enhanced Execution Environment**

* Use of real Jupyter kernel via `jupyter_client` or `nbclient`.
* Detailed error analysis and correction suggestions.
* Visual output interpretation (text or image-based).

#### 3. **Advanced Agent Capabilities**

* Self-correction through feedback analysis.
* Multi-agent design:

  * **Orchestrator** (Planner)
  * **Coder** (Executor)
  * **Reviewer** (QA)
* Human-in-the-loop support.
* Knowledge base for reuse of common patterns.

#### 4. **Improved Workspace Perception**

* Automatic schema inference.
* Preview and analyze sample data to inform steps.

#### 5. **User Interface**

* Web UI for setting objectives, monitoring progress, reviewing results, and providing feedback.

### Conclusion

This concept introduces a transformative approach to automating data science workflows. The key challenges lie in making LLM interactions contextually aware, iterative, and resilient to execution feedback. When fully realized, this system can significantly reduce the manual burden in data science notebook development and accelerate insight discovery.
